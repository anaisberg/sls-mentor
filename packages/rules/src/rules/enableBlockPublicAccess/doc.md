# Enable Block Public Access

The Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature provides settings for access points, buckets, and accounts to help you manage public access to Amazon S3 resources.
By default, new buckets don't allow public access. However, users can modify bucket permissions to allow public access.
It is recommended to enable Block Public Access for security reasons to prevent public access to your Amazon S3 resources.
