# _Backup_: Defined Backup Retention Period or Transition to Cold Storage

Make sure you do not forgot to set a retention period or at least a transition to cold storage date for each rule of your backup plan! You certainly don't need to keep backups for an indefinite period, especially on your dev and staging environments. üòâ  
Avoid unnecessary data storage by setting a transition to cold storage date and/or a retention period! ‚è∞

Look into your Backup Plan in your AWS Backup service and open a Backup Rule. Here you can see the lifecycle configuration of the rule: Transition to cold storage and Retention period.
